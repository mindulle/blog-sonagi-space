Platform class
==============

Information about the environment in which the current program is
running.

Platform provides information such as the operating system, the hostname
of the computer, the value of environment variables, the path to the
running program, and other global properties of the program being run.

Get the URI of the current Dart script
--------------------------------------

Use the [script](platform/script) getter to get the URI to the currently
running Dart script.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
import 'dart:io' show Platform;

void main() {
  // Get the URI of the script being run.
  var uri = Platform.script;
  // Convert the URI to a path.
  var path = uri.toFilePath();
}
```

Get the value of an environment variable
----------------------------------------

The [environment](platform/environment) getter returns a the names and
values of environment variables in a [Map](../dart-core/map-class) that
contains key-value pairs of strings. The Map is unmodifiable. This
sample shows how to get the value of the `PATH` environment variable.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
import 'dart:io' show Platform;

void main() {
  Map<String, String> envVars = Platform.environment;
  print(envVars['PATH']);
}
```

Determine the OS
----------------

You can get the name of the operating system as a string with the
[operatingSystem](platform/operatingsystem) getter. You can also use one
of the static boolean getters: [isMacOS](platform/ismacos),
[isLinux](platform/islinux), [isWindows](platform/iswindows), etc.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
import 'dart:io' show Platform;

void main() {
  // Get the operating system as a string.
  String os = Platform.operatingSystem;
  // Or, use a predicate getter.
  if (Platform.isMacOS) {
    print('is a Mac');
  } else {
    print('is not a Mac');
  }
}
```
