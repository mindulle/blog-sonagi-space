asFloat64x2List method

[Float64x2List](../float64x2list-class) asFloat64x2List(

::: {.features}

:::

Creates a [Float64x2List](../float64x2list-class) *view* of a region of
this byte buffer.

The view is backed by the bytes of this byte buffer. Any changes made to
the `Float64x2List` will also change the buffer, and vice versa.

The viewed region start at `offsetInBytes`, which must be 128-bit
aligned, and contains `length` 128-bit integers. If `length` is omitted,
the range extends as far towards the end of the buffer as possible - if
[lengthInBytes](lengthinbytes) is not divisible by 16, the last bytes
can\'t be part of the view.

The start index and length must describe a valid 128-bit aligned range
of the buffer:

-   `offsetInBytes` must not be negative,
-   `offsetInBytes` must be divisible by sixteen,
-   `length` must not be negative, and
-   `offsetInBytes + length * 16` must not be greater than
    [lengthInBytes](lengthinbytes).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Float64x2List asFloat64x2List([int offsetInBytes = 0, int? length]) =>
    new UnmodifiableFloat64x2ListView(
        _data.asFloat64x2List(offsetInBytes, length));
```
