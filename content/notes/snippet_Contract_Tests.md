# Ensure New Releases Dont Break The Api Using Contract Tests

## 설명


## 코드 (javascript)
```javascript
/* Ensure new releases don’t break the API using contract tests */

/**
 * ✅Do
 * So your Microservice has multiple clients, and you run multiple versions of the service for compatibility reasons(keeping everyone happy).
 * Then you change some field and ‘boom!’, some important client who relies on this field is angry.
 *
 * This is the Catch - 22 of the integration world: It’s very challenging for the server side to consider all the multiple client expectations — On the other hand, the clients can’t perform any testing because the server controls the release dates.
 * There is a spectrum of techniques that can mitigate the contract problem, some are simple, other are more feature - rich and demand a steeper learning curve.
 *
 * In a simple and recommended approach, the API provider publishes npm package with the API typing(e.g.JSDoc, TypeScript).
 * Then the consumers can fetch this library and benefit from codign time intellisense and validation.
 *
 * A fancier approach is to use[PACT](https://docs.pact.io/) which was born to formalize this process with a very disruptive approach — not the server defines the test plan itself rather the client defines the tests of the… server!
 * PACT can record the client expectation and put it in a shared location, “broker”, so the server can pull the expectations and run on every build using the PACT library to detect broken contracts — a client expectation that is not met.
 * By doing so, all the server-client API mismatches are caught early during build/CI and might save you a great deal of frustration
 */

/**
 * ❌ Otherwise
 * The alternatives are exhausting manual testing or deployment fear
