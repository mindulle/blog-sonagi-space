HttpServer class
================

A server that delivers content, such as web pages, using the HTTP
protocol.

Note: [HttpServer](httpserver-class) provides low-level HTTP
functionality. We recommend users evaluate the high-level APIs discussed
at [Write HTTP servers](https://dart.dev/tutorials/server/httpserver) on
[dart.dev](https://dart.dev/).

`HttpServer` is a [Stream](../dart-async/stream-class) that provides
[HttpRequest](httprequest-class) objects. Each `HttpRequest` has an
associated [HttpResponse](httpresponse-class) object. The server
responds to a request by writing to that
[HttpResponse](httpresponse-class) object. The following example shows
how to bind an `HttpServer` to an IPv6
[InternetAddress](internetaddress-class) on port 80 (the standard port
for HTTP servers) and how to listen for requests. Port 80 is the default
HTTP port. However, on most systems accessing this requires super-user
privileges. For local testing consider using a non-reserved port (1024
and above).

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
import 'dart:io';

void main() async {
  var server = await HttpServer.bind(InternetAddress.anyIPv6, 80);
  await server.forEach((HttpRequest request) {
    request.response.write('Hello, world!');
    request.response.close();
  });
}
```

Incomplete requests, in which all or part of the header is missing, are
ignored, and no exceptions or [HttpRequest](httprequest-class) objects
are generated for them. Likewise, when writing to an
[HttpResponse](httpresponse-class), any [Socket](socket-class)
exceptions are ignored and any future writes are ignored.

The [HttpRequest](httprequest-class) exposes the request headers and
provides the request body, if it exists, as a Stream of data. If the
body is unread, it is drained when the server writes to the HttpResponse
or closes it.

Bind with a secure HTTPS connection
-----------------------------------

Use [bindSecure](httpserver/bindsecure) to create an HTTPS server.

The server presents a certificate to the client. The certificate chain
and the private key are set in the
[SecurityContext](securitycontext-class) object that is passed to
[bindSecure](httpserver/bindsecure).

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
import 'dart:io';

void main() async {
  var chain =
      Platform.script.resolve('certificates/server_chain.pem').toFilePath();
  var key = Platform.script.resolve('certificates/server_key.pem').toFilePath();
  var context = SecurityContext()
    ..useCertificateChain(chain)
    ..usePrivateKey(key, password: 'dartdart');
  var server =
      await HttpServer.bindSecure(InternetAddress.anyIPv6, 443, context);
  await server.forEach((HttpRequest request) {
    request.response.write('Hello, world!');
    request.response.close();
  });
}
```

The certificates and keys are PEM files, which can be created and
managed with the tools in OpenSSL.

Implemented types

:   -   [Stream](../dart-async/stream-class)\<[HttpRequest](httprequest-class)\>

Constructors
------------

[HttpServer.listenOn](httpserver/httpserver.listenon)([ServerSocket](serversocket-class)
serverSocket)

::: {.constructor-modifier .features}

[ServerSocket](serversocket-class). When the
[HttpServer](httpserver-class) is closed, the
[HttpServer](httpserver-class) will just detach itself, closing current
connections but not closing `serverSocket`.

--------------

[bind](httpserver/bind)(dynamic address, [int](../dart-core/int-class) port, {[int](../dart-core/int-class) backlog = 0, [bool](../dart-core/bool-class) v6Only = false, [bool](../dart-core/bool-class) shared = false}) → [Future](../dart-async/future-class)\<[HttpServer](httpserver-class)\>
:   Starts listening for HTTP requests on the specified `address` and
    `port`.

[bindSecure](httpserver/bindsecure)(dynamic address, [int](../dart-core/int-class) port, [SecurityContext](securitycontext-class) context, {[int](../dart-core/int-class) backlog = 0, [bool](../dart-core/bool-class) v6Only = false, [bool](../dart-core/bool-class) requestClientCertificate = false, [bo
ol](../dart-core/bool-class) shared = false}) → [Future](../dart-async/future-class)\<[HttpServer](httpserver-class)\>
:   The `address` can either be a [String](../dart-core/string-class) or
    an [InternetAddress](internetaddress-class). If `address` is a
    [String](../dart-core/string-class), [bind](httpserver/bind) will
    perform a [InternetAddress.lookup](internetaddress/lookup) and use
    the first value in the list. To listen on the loopback adapter,
    which will allow only incoming connections from the local host, use
    the value
    [InternetAddress.loopbackIPv4](internetaddress/loopbackipv4) or
    [InternetAddress.loopbackIPv6](internetaddress/loopbackipv6). To
    allow for incoming connection from the network use either one of the
    values [InternetAddress.anyIPv4](internetaddress/anyipv4) or
    [InternetAddress.anyIPv6](internetaddress/anyipv6) to bind to all
    interfaces or the IP address of a specific interface.
