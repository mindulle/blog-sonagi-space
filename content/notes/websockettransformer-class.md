WebSocketTransformer class
==========================

The [WebSocketTransformer](websockettransformer-class) provides the
ability to upgrade a [HttpRequest](httprequest-class) to a
[WebSocket](websocket-class) connection. It supports both upgrading a
single [HttpRequest](httprequest-class) and upgrading a stream of
[HttpRequest](httprequest-class)s.

To upgrade a single [HttpRequest](httprequest-class) use the static
[upgrade](websockettransformer/upgrade) method.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
HttpServer server;
server.listen((request) {
  if (...) {
    WebSocketTransformer.upgrade(request).then((websocket) {
      ...
    });
  } else {
    // Do normal HTTP request processing.
  }
});
```

To transform a stream of [HttpRequest](httprequest-class) events as it
implements a stream transformer that transforms a stream of HttpRequest
into a stream of WebSockets by upgrading each HttpRequest from the HTTP
or HTTPS server, to the WebSocket protocol.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
server.transform(new WebSocketTransformer()).listen((webSocket) => ...);
```

This transformer strives to implement WebSockets as specified by
RFC6455.

Transforms the provided `stream`.

[cast](../dart-async/streamtransformer/cast)\<RS, RT\>() →
[StreamTransformer](../dart-async/streamtransformer-class)\<RS, RT\>

Static Methods
--------------

[isUpgradeRequest](websockettransformer/isupgraderequest)([HttpRequest](httprequest-class) request) → [bool](../dart-core/bool-class)
:   Checks whether the request is a valid WebSocket upgrade request.

[upgrade](websockettransformer/upgrade)([HttpRequest](httprequest-class) request, {dynamic protocolSelector([List](../dart-core/list-class)\<[String](../dart-core/string-class)\> protocols)?, [CompressionOptions](compressionoptions-class) compression = CompressionOptions.compressionDefault}) → [Futu
re](../dart-async/future-class)\<[WebSocket](websocket-class)\>
:   Upgrades a [HttpRequest](httprequest-class) to a `WebSocket`
    connection. If the request is not a valid WebSocket upgrade request
    an HTTP response with status code 500 will be returned. Otherwise
    the returned future will complete with the `WebSocket` when the
    upgrade process is complete.
