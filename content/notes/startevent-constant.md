===================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[EventStreamProvider](../eventstreamprovider-class)\<[SpeechSynthesisEvent](../speechsynthesisevent-class)\>
const startEvent
:::

Static factory designed to expose `start` events to event handlers that

See [EventStreamProvider](../eventstreamprovider-class) for usage
information.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
static const EventStreamProvider<SpeechSynthesisEvent> startEvent =
    const EventStreamProvider<SpeechSynthesisEvent>('start');
