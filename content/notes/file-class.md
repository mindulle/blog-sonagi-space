File class
==========

A reference to a file on the file system.

A `File` holds a [path](file/path) on which operations can be performed.
You can get the parent directory of the file using
[parent](filesystementity/parent), a property inherited from
[FileSystemEntity](filesystementity-class).

Create a new `File` object with a pathname to access the specified file
on the file system from your program.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
var myFile = File('file.txt');
```

The `File` class contains methods for manipulating files and their
contents. Using methods in this class, you can open and close files,
read to and write from them, create and delete them, and check for their
existence.

When reading or writing a file, you can use streams (with
[openRead](file/openread)), random access operations (with
[open](file/open)), or convenience methods such as
[readAsString](file/readasstring),

Most methods in this class occur in synchronous and asynchronous pairs,
for example, [readAsString](file/readasstring) and
[readAsStringSync](file/readasstringsync). Unless you have a specific
reason for using the synchronous version of a method, prefer the
asynchronous version to avoid blocking your program.

If path is a link
-----------------

If [path](file/path) is a symbolic link, rather than a file, then the
methods of `File` operate on the ultimate target of the link, except for
[delete](filesystementity/delete) and
[deleteSync](filesystementity/deletesync), which operate on the link.

Read from a file
----------------

The following code sample reads the entire contents from a file as a
string using the asynchronous [readAsString](file/readasstring) method:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  File('file.txt').readAsString().then((String contents) {
    print(contents);
  });
}
```

A more flexible and useful way to read a file is with a
[Stream](../dart-async/stream-class). Open the file with
[openRead](file/openread), which returns a stream that provides the data
in the file as chunks of bytes. Read the stream to process the file
contents when available. You can use various transformers in succession
to manipulate the file content into the required format, or to prepare
it for output.

You might want to use a stream to read large files, to manipulate the
data with transformers, or for compatibility with another API, such as
[WebSocket](websocket-class)s.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
import 'dart:io';
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:async';

void main() async {
  final file = File('file.txt');
  Stream<String> lines = file.openRead()
    .transform(utf8.decoder)       // Decode bytes to UTF-8.
    .transform(LineSplitter());    // Convert stream to individual lines.
  try {
    await for (var line in lines) {
      print('$line: ${line.length} characters');
    }
    print('File is now closed.');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  }
}
```

Write to a file
---------------

To write a string to a file, use the [writeAsString](file/writeasstring)
method:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
import 'dart:io';

void main() async {
  final filename = 'file.txt';
  var file = await File(filename).writeAsString('some content');
  // Do something with the file.
}
```

You can also write to a file using a
[Stream](../dart-async/stream-class). Open the file with
[openWrite](file/openwrite), which returns an [IOSink](iosink-class) to
which you can write data. Be sure to close the sink with the
[IOSink.close](iosink/close) method.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  var file = File('file.txt');
  var sink = file.openWrite();
  sink.write('FILE ACCESSED ${DateTime.now()}\n');

  // Close the IOSink to free system resources.
  sink.close();
}
```

The use of asynchronous methods
-------------------------------

To avoid unintentional blocking of the program, several methods are
asynchronous and return a [Future](../dart-async/future-class). For
example, the [length](file/length) method, which gets the length of a
file, returns a [Future](../dart-async/future-class). Wait for the
future to get the result when it\'s ready.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
import 'dart:io';

void main() async {
  final file = File('file.txt');

  var length = await file.length();
  print(length);
}
```

In addition to length, the [exists](filesystementity/exists),
[lastModified](file/lastmodified), [stat](filesystementity/stat), and
other methods, are asynchronous.
