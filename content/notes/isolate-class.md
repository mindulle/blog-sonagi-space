Isolate class
=============

An isolated Dart execution context.

All Dart code runs in an isolate, and code can access classes and values
only from the same isolate. Different isolates can communicate by
sending values through ports (see [ReceivePort](receiveport-class),
[SendPort](sendport-class)).

An `Isolate` object is a reference to an isolate, usually different from
the current isolate. It represents, and can be used to control, the
other isolate.

When spawning a new isolate, the spawning isolate receives an `Isolate`
object representing the new isolate when the spawn operation succeeds.

Isolates run code in its own event loop, and each event may run smaller
tasks in a nested microtask queue.

An `Isolate` object allows other isolates to control the event loop of
the isolate that it represents, and to inspect the isolate, for example
by pausing the isolate or by getting events when the isolate has an
uncaught error.

The [controlPort](isolate/controlport) identifies and gives access to
controlling the isolate, and the
[pauseCapability](isolate/pausecapability) and
[terminateCapability](isolate/terminatecapability) guard access to some
control operations. For example, calling [pause](isolate/pause) on an
`Isolate` object created without a
[pauseCapability](isolate/pausecapability), has no effect.

The `Isolate` object provided by a spawn operation will have the control
port and capabilities needed to control the isolate. New isolate objects
can be created without some of these capabilities if necessary, using
the [Isolate.Isolate](isolate/isolate) constructor.

An `Isolate` object cannot be sent over a `SendPort`, but the control
port and capabilities can be sent, and can be used to create a new
functioning `Isolate` object in the receiving port\'s isolate.

Constructors
------------

[Isolate](isolate/isolate)([SendPort](sendport-class) controlPort, {[Capability](capability-class)? pauseCapability, [Capability](capability-class)? terminateCapability})
:   Creates a new [Isolate](isolate-class) object with a restricted set
    of capabilities.
