A pointer to the element whose CSS selector matched within which an
event was fired. If this Event was not associated with any Event
delegation, accessing this value will throw an
[UnsupportedError](../../dart-core/unsupportederror-class).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Element get matchingTarget {
  if (_selector == null) {
    throw new UnsupportedError('Cannot call matchingTarget if this Event did'
        ' not arise as a result of event delegation.');
  }
  Element? currentTarget = this.currentTarget as Element?;
  Element? target = this.target as Element?;
  do {
    if (target!.matches(_selector!)) return target;
    target = target.parent;
  } while (target != null && target != currentTarget!.parent);
  throw new StateError('No selector matched for populating matchedTarget.');
}
```
