:::

Creates a [Int8List](../int8list-class) *view* of a region of this byte
buffer.

The view is backed by the bytes of this byte buffer. Any changes made to
the `Int8List` will also change the buffer, and vice versa.

The viewed region start at `offsetInBytes` and contains `length` bytes.
If `length` is omitted, the range extends to the end of the buffer.

The start index and length must describe a valid range of the buffer:

-   `offsetInBytes` must not be negative,
-   `length` must not be negative, and
-   `offsetInBytes + length` must not be greater than
    [lengthInBytes](lengthinbytes).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Int8List asInt8List([int offsetInBytes = 0, int? length]) =>
    new UnmodifiableInt8ListView(_data.asInt8List(offsetInBytes, length));
```
