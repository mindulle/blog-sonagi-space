read method
===========

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Uint8List](../../dart-typed_data/uint8list-class)? read(

1.  \[[int](../../dart-core/int-class)? len\]

)
:::

Read up to `len` bytes from the socket.

This function is non-blocking and will only return data if data is
available. The number of bytes read can be less then `len` if fewer
bytes are available for immediate reading. If no data is available
`null` is returned.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Uint8List? read([int? len]);
```
