[Future](../../dart-async/future-class)\<S\> socket

:::

A `Future` that completes with value that `S.connect()` would return
unless [cancel](cancel) is called on this
[ConnectionTask](../connectiontask-class).

If [cancel](cancel) is called, the future completes with a
[SocketException](../socketexception-class) error whose message
indicates that the connection attempt was cancelled.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final Future<S> socket;
```
