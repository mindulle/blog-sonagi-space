readIntoSync method
===================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[int](../../dart-core/int-class) readIntoSync(

1.  [List](../../dart-core/list-class)\<[int](../../dart-core/int-class)\>
    buffer,
2.  \[[int](../../dart-core/int-class) start = 0,
3.  [int](../../dart-core/int-class)? end\]

)
:::

Synchronously reads into an existing `buffer`.

Reads bytes and writes then into the range of `buffer` from `start` to
`end`. The `start` must be non-negative and no greater than
`buffer`.length. If `end` is omitted, it defaults to `buffer`.length.
Otherwise `end` must be no less than `start` and no greater than
`buffer`.length.

Returns the number of bytes read. This maybe be less than `end - start`
if the file doesn\'t have that many bytes to read.

Throws a [FileSystemException](../filesystemexception-class) if the
operation fails.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
int readIntoSync(List<int> buffer, [int start = 0, int? end]);
```
