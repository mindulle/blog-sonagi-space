double class
============

A double-precision floating point number.

Representation of Dart doubles containing double specific constants and
operations and specializations of operations inherited from
[num](num-class). Dart doubles are 64-bit floating-point numbers as
specified in the IEEE 754 standard.

The [double](double-class) type is contagious. Operations on
[double](double-class)s return [double](double-class) results.

It is a compile-time error for a class to attempt to extend or implement
double.
