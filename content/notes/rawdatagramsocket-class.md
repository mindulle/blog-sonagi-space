RawDatagramSocket class
=======================

An unbuffered interface to a UDP socket.

The raw datagram socket delivers the datagrams in the same chunks as the
underlying operating system. It\'s a
[Stream](../dart-async/stream-class) of
[RawSocketEvent](rawsocketevent-class)s.

Note that the event
[RawSocketEvent.readClosed](rawsocketevent/readclosed-constant) will
never be received as an UDP socket cannot be closed by a remote peer.

It is not the same as a [POSIX raw
socket](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/raw.7.html).
