Initiates TLS on an existing server connection.

Takes an already connected `socket` and starts server side TLS handshake
to make the communication secure. When the returned future completes the
`RawSecureSocket` has completed the TLS handshake. Using this function
requires that the other end of the connection is going to start the TLS
handshake.

If the `socket` already has a subscription, pass the existing
subscription in the `subscription` parameter. The
[secureServer](secureserver) operation will take over the subscription
by replacing the handlers with it own secure processing. The caller must
not touch this subscription anymore. Passing a paused subscription is an
error.

If some of the data of the TLS handshake has already been read from the
socket this data can be passed in the `bufferedData` parameter. This
data will be processed before any other data available on the socket.

See [RawSecureServerSocket.bind](../rawsecureserversocket/bind) for more
information on the arguments.

    RawSocket socket, SecurityContext? context,
    {StreamSubscription<RawSocketEvent>? subscription,

    bool requireClientCertificate = false,
    List<String>? supportedProtocols}) {
  socket.readEventsEnabled = false;
  socket.writeEventsEnabled = false;
  return _RawSecureSocket.connect(
      socket.address, socket.remotePort, true, socket,
      context: context,
      subscription: subscription,
      bufferedData: bufferedData,
      requestClientCertificate: requestClientCertificate,
      requireClientCertificate: requireClientCertificate,
      supportedProtocols: supportedProtocols);

Initiates TLS on an existing server connection.

Takes an already connected `socket` and starts server side TLS handshake
to make the communication secure. When the returned future completes the
`SecureSocket` has completed the TLS handshake. Using this function
requires that the other end of the connection is going to start the TLS
handshake.

If the `socket` already has a subscription, this subscription will no
longer receive and events. In most cases calling
[StreamSubscription.pause](../../dart-async/streamsubscription/pause) on
this subscription before starting TLS handshake is the right thing to
do.

If some of the data of the TLS handshake has already been read from the
socket this data can be passed in the `bufferedData` parameter. This
data will be processed before any other data available on the socket.

See [SecureServerSocket.bind](../secureserversocket/bind) for more
information on the arguments.

    return RawSecureSocket.secureServer(detachedRaw[0] as RawSocket, context,
