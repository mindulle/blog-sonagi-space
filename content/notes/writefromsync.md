writeFromSync method
====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
void writeFromSync(

1.  [List](../../dart-core/list-class)\<[int](../../dart-core/int-class)\>
    buffer,
2.  \[[int](../../dart-core/int-class) start = 0,
3.  [int](../../dart-core/int-class)? end\]

)
:::

Synchronously writes from a `buffer` to the file.

Will read the buffer from index `start` to index `end`. The `start` must
be non-negative and no greater than `buffer`.length. If `end` is
omitted, it defaults to `buffer`.length. Otherwise `end` must be no less
than `start` and no greater than `buffer`.length.

Throws a [FileSystemException](../filesystemexception-class) if the
operation fails.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
void writeFromSync(List<int> buffer, [int start = 0, int? end]);
