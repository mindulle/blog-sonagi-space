# Point Lights

Point lights are one of the most common types of lights used in computer graphics and games. They resemble real-world light bulbs, emitting light uniformly in all directions. These lights are available out of the box in most game engines and offer a range of customizable parameters, such as intensit
y, falloff, color, and more. Point lights are the most straightforward type of light, making them ideal for quickly and intuitively lighting up your scenes.
