IOOverrides class
=================

Facilities for overriding various APIs of `dart:io` with mock
implementations.

This abstract base class should be extended with overrides for the
operations needed to construct mocks. The implementations in this base
class default to the actual `dart:io` implementation. For example:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
class MyDirectory implements Directory {
  ...
  // An implementation of the Directory interface
  ...
}

void main() {
  IOOverrides.runZoned(() {
    ...
    // Operations will use MyDirectory instead of dart:io's Directory
    // implementation whenever Directory is used.
    ...
  }, createDirectory: (String path) => new MyDirectory(path));
}
```
