WebSocket class
===============

A two-way HTTP communication object for client or server applications.

The stream exposes the messages received. A text message will be of type
`String` and a binary message will be of type `List<int>`.

Implemented types

## 상세 내용 (Merged from 20_Wiki/Develop/References/dart2/dart-html/websocket-class.md)
[dart:html](../dart-html/dart-html-library){._links-link}

WebSocket class
===============

Use the WebSocket interface to connect to a WebSocket, and to send and
receive data on that WebSocket.

To use a WebSocket in your web app, first create a WebSocket object,
passing the WebSocket URL as an argument to the constructor.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
var webSocket = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:1337/ws');
```

To send data on the WebSocket, use the [send](websocket/send) method.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
if (webSocket != null && webSocket.readyState == WebSocket.OPEN) {
  webSocket.send(data);
} else {
  print('WebSocket not connected, message $data not sent');
}
```

To receive data on the WebSocket, register a listener for message
events.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
webSocket.onMessage.listen((MessageEvent e) {
  receivedData(e.data);
});
```

The message event handler receives a [MessageEvent](messageevent-class)
object as its sole argument. You can also define open, close, and error
handlers, as specified by [Event](event-class)s.

For more information, see the
[WebSockets](http://www.dartlang.org/docs/library-tour/#html-websockets)
section of the library tour and [Introducing
WebSockets](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/websockets/basics/),
