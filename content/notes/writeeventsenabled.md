writeEventsEnabled property
===========================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[bool](../../dart-core/bool-class) writeEventsEnabled

::: {.features}
read / write

:::

Whether the [RawDatagramSocket](../rawdatagramsocket-class) should
listen for [RawSocketEvent.write](../rawsocketevent/write-constant)
events.

Default is `true`. This is a one-shot listener, and
[writeEventsEnabled](writeeventsenabled) must be set to true again to
receive another write event.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
abstract bool writeEventsEnabled;
```
